## FAQ

### What is "proxy.pleasedontbearealdomain.com"?

That is my own website, i (neikidev) own the website "pleasedontbearealdomain.com", i use the proxy subdomain
to access the kaspersky opentip data over an proxy to disable the "cors" error. It doesnt store any user data or anything!

Script doesnt work if you are on the community work or click on a virustotal link that ends on `/community`.
